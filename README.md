# SMSafety: Android Safety App

SMSafeyy is an Android mobile safety app that allows you to send an alert message to the added emergency contacts when emergency button is pressed.
This message contains information that notifies that the user is in danger and provides a google map link of the user's location. It utilizes Android Studio's Location library to retrieve the user's coordinates and SMS Library to automatically send a message to the saved close contacts.
